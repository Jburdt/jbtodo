# TODO APP

- This is just a basic todo app to help me practice the fundimentals of Ruby on Rails. I'll keep adding things in periodically to keep practicing so if the App doesn't look great sometimes or has bugs, it may be because I'm slowly continuing the build.

## Requirments to run app

- git clone git@github.com:Jburdt/jbtodo.git
- bin/rails db:setup
- bin/dev

## Things I learned creating this app

* Render deployment
* Turbo
* Devise - popular gem in Rails for authentication
